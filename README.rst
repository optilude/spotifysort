Spotify Sort
============

This is a command line tool that uses libspotify (version 0.0.6) to sort
all playlists and playlist folders in your Spotify library alphabetically.

Requires libspotify.framework to be installed, probably by copying it to
/Library/Frameworks. See https://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/overview.

Tested on Mac OS X 10.6. Use XCode to build.

Please use with caution and keep backups.
